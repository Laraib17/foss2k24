# Open Plant Monitor

An open hardware project for monitoring plant health using readily available components.

## Overview

This project aims to create an affordable, easy-to-build plant monitoring system that measures:
- Soil moisture
- Light levels
- Temperature
- Humidity

## Components

- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno or ESP8266)
- Soil moisture sensor
- Light sensor (photoresistor)
- Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11 or DHT22)
- OLED display

## Current Status

This project is in the initial development stage. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
